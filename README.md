**Task Planner README**

**Description:**
This README provides an overview of a console-based task planner application implemented in C#. The application allows users to organize their tasks into different categories and manage them efficiently through a set of interactive menu options.

**File: TaskPlanner.cs**
The "TaskPlanner.cs" file contains the implementation of the task planner application. It includes classes for representing tasks and categories, as well as the main application logic within the TaskPlanner class.

**Class: Task**
The Task class represents a single task with properties such as name, due date, color tag, and priority. It provides a constructor for initializing task objects with the given parameters.

**Class: Category**
The Category class represents a category of tasks with a name and a list of tasks. It includes a constructor for initializing a new category with the given name and an empty list of tasks.

**Class: TaskPlanner**
The TaskPlanner class serves as the main class for the task planner application. It contains the application logic, including methods for adding, deleting, and moving tasks, as well as managing categories. The Main method serves as the entry point of the application.

**Functionality:**
- Add a task: Allows users to add a new task to a specific category with details such as name, due date, color tag, and priority.
- Delete a task: Enables users to delete a task from the task planner.
- Move a task: Allows users to move a task from one category to another.
- Add a category: Enables users to create a new category for organizing tasks.
- Delete a category: Allows users to delete an existing category along with its associated tasks.
- Exit: Terminates the program execution.

**Usage:**
1. Run the program.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to perform various task management operations.
3. Continue managing tasks until you choose to exit the program.
